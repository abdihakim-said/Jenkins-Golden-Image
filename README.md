Overview
The Jenkins Golden Image project automates the creation of a secure, consistent, and production-ready Jenkins server Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using Packer. This image can be deployed quickly in AWS environments, ensuring infrastructure consistency and reducing manual setup time.

Features
Automated Image Creation: Easily build a Jenkins AMI with all required configurations.
Custom Role Integration: Package custom Ansible roles and playbooks with your Jenkins setup.
Version-Controlled: Reproduce builds with specific Packer versions for reliability.
AWS Integration: Uses environment variables for secure AWS authentication.
Fast Deployment: Reduce provisioning time by launching pre-baked Jenkins images.

Packer v1.8.7 (tested version)
AWS account with EC2 and AMI permissions
AWS CLI configured or AWS credentials exported as environment variables
